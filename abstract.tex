We present simplicial neural networks (SNNs), a generalization of graph neural networks to data that live on a class of topological spaces called simplicial complexes.
These are natural multi-dimensional extensions of graphs that encode not only pairwise relationships but also higher-order interactions between vertices. We define an appropriate notion of convolution for such data, which we leverage to construct the desired convolutional neural networks. This allows us to consider richer data than traditional methods, including vector field data and $n$-fold collaboration networks.
Finally, we test the ability of the SNNs on the task of imputing missing data on simplicial complexes built from coauthorship data.
