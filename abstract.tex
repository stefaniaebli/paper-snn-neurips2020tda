In this paper we present simplicial neural networks (SNNs), a generalization of graph convolutional neural networks to data that live on a class of topological spaces called simplicial complexes. These are natural multi-dimensional extensions of graphs which encode more than just pairwise relationships, namely higher-order relationships between nodes (represented geometrically as filled triangles, tetrahedra, and so forth). We define an appropriate notion of convolutions for such data, which we leverage to construct the desired convolutional neural networks. This allows us to consider richer data than traditional methods, including n-fold collaboration networks and vector field data.
