In this paper we present simplicial neural networks (SNNs)\gard{I feel the word convolution should be in the name. There can potentially be other simplicial networks out there; ours are decidedly \emph{convolutional}.} \stefania{ASked also K about the title. THere are no simplicial neural networks out there. Even if simplicial convolutional neural networks is maybe a more complete name we think simplicial neutal networks is more catchy..}, a generalization of graph convolutional neural networks to data that live on a class of topological spaces called simplicial complexes. These are natural multi-dimensional extensions of graphs which encode more than just pairwise relationships, namely higher-order relationships between nodes (represented geometrically as filled triangles, tetrahedra, and so forth). We define an appropriate notion of convolutions for such data, which we leverage to construct the desired convolutional neural networks. This allows us to consider richer data than traditional methods, including $n$-fold collaboration networks and vector field data.
