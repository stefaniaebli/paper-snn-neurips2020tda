\begin{itemize}
    \item Mention anisotropy (can't do shifts) (because filters are constant by eigenspaces, i.e.\ don't act on the phase), and how that might be an unnecessary price to pay~\cite{defferrard2020deepsphere}.
    \item Upload to openreview and arxiv (same version).
    \item Make poster (1-page PDF in landscape).
\end{itemize}
