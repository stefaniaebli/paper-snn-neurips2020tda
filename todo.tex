\begin{itemize}
    \item Mention anisotropy (can't do shifts) (because filters are constant by eigenspaces, i.e.\ don't act on the phase), and how that might be an unnecessary price to pay~\cite{defferrard2020deepsphere}.
    \item More powerful last paragraph (must leave an impression to the reader). Idea: spectral language enables a principled generalization of convolution (weight sharing) to non-homogeneous spaces (beyond equivariance to symmetry group action). Although we're not sure what that means (local isometry?).
    \item Link to public code repository. Also on arxiv/paperwithcode.
    \item Upload to openreview and arxiv (same version).
    \item Make poster (1-page PDF in landscape).
\end{itemize}
