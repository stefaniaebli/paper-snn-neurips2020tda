\begin{itemize}
    \item Mention anisotropy (because filters are constant by eigenspaces, i.e.\ don't act on the phase), and how it might be an unnecessary price to pay~\cite{defferrard2020deepsphere}.
    \item More powerful last paragraph (must leave an impression to the reader).
    \item Link to public code repositorie(s). Also on arxiv/paperwithcode.
