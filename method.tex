\section{Proposed Technique}
In this section we introduce the simplicial neural networks (SNNs). The first step to generalize GNNs to simplicial complexes~\cite{hatcher} is to design localized convolutional filters on simplicial complexes or equivalently to define a localized message passing operator on simplices. This role will be played by the simplicial laplacians, a well-known operator encoding topological information on the simplcial complex~\cite{horak2013spectra},~\cite{eckmann1944}.
