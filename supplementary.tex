\textbf{Coauthorship complexes.}\stefania{Say here how we interpret subsimplices}
We report in the following table the number of simplices in dimension $k=0,1,2$ of the co-authorship complexes CC1 and CC2.
\begin{table}[htbp]

  \scriptsize{
  \begin{tabular}{llllllllllll}
    \cmidrule(r){1-12}
    Dimension:   & 0     & 1  & 2     & 3 & 4     & 5 & 6    & 7 & 8   & 9 & 10\\

    CC1 & 352  & 1474  & 3285  & 5019  & 5559  & 4547  & 2732  & 1175  & 343 & 61 & 5\\
    CC2 & 1126 & 5059 & 11840 & 18822 & 21472 & 17896  & 10847 & 4673 & 1357 & 238 & 19\\

\textbf{Glossary Missing Data Imputation.} We state here some definitions and criteria that are used in the results section. 

A missing value is predicted correctly if the imputed value differs of at most $1$ from the actual values. 

The accuracy is defined as the percentage of missing values that has been correctly imputed and the absolute error (AE) as the magnitude of the difference between the predicted and actual citation.

For the same percentage of missing values we consider different random samples of the damaged portions. Then a statistical evaluation of the performance of the network is given by the mean accuracy (MA), the mean of the accuracy over different samples and the mean absolute error (MAE), the mean of the error over different samples.\stefania{I say some bullshits here. Is the mean distribution}
