\paragraph{Simplicial distance and the localizing property of the Laplacian.}
Suppose that $\sigma$ and $\tau$ are $p$-simplices for which $(\nu_0, \nu_1, \dotsc, \nu_d)$ is the shortest sequence of $p$-simplices with the property that $\nu_0=\sigma$, $\nu_d=\tau$, and each $\nu_i$ shares a face or a coface with $\nu_{i-1}$, and a face or a coface with $\nu_{i+1}$. We say that $d$ is the \emph{simplicial distance} between $\sigma$ and $\tau$. Then for all $N<d$, the entry of $L_p^N$ corresponding to $\sigma$ and $\tau$ is $0$, and so the filter does not cause interaction between $c(\sigma)$ and $c(\tau)$. This is analogous to a size-$d$ ordinary CNN layer not distributing information between pixels that are more than $d$ pixels apart. We will refer to $N$ as the \emph{degree} of the convolutional layer, but one may well wish to keep in mind the notion of \emph{size} from traditional CNNs.

\paragraph{Simplicial complexes as the projections of bipartite graphs.}
Given a bipartite graph $X$-$Y$, the simplicial projection on $Y$ is the simplicial complex whose $(k-1)$-simplices are the sets of $k$ vertices in $Y$ that have at least one common neighbor in $X$.
Cochains on the simplicial projection are naturally given by weights on $X$: Given any $(k-1)$-simplex $[y_1,\dots,y_k]$ and its neighboring vertices $\{x_1,\dots,x_j\}\subseteq X$, one can define a $(k-1)$-cochain as $\phi(\{x_1,\dots,x_j\})$, for any function $\phi: \mathcal{P(X)}\to\RR$.
In our coauthorship application, $\phi$ is the sum and the weight of a paper is the number of times it is cited.
See Figure~\ref{fig:bipartite}.

\paragraph{Sampling papers.}
From the Semantic Scholar Open Research Corpus~\cite{ammar18NAACL}, we excluded papers with fewer than $5$ citations or more than $10$ authors.
To sample a CC, we sampled $80$ papers (corresponding to maximal simplices in the CC) by performing a random walk (of length $80$) on the graph whose vertices represent papers and edges connect papers sharing at least one author.

\paragraph{Mean accuracy and absolute error.}
A missing value is considered to be correctly imputed if the imputed value differs by at most $10\%$ from the true value.
The \emph{accuracy} is the percentage of missing values that has been correctly imputed and the \emph{absolute error} is the magnitude of the difference between the imputed and true value.
For each rate of missing values, we compute the \emph{mean accuracy} $\pm$ standard deviation over 5 samples with randomly damaged portions.
