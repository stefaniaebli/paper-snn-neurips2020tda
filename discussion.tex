\section{Conlusion and Future Work}

In this work we have introduced a new mathematical framework to design neural networks dealing with simplicial complex and showed preliminary results of their ability in imputing missing data. We believe that SNNs can provide a suitable method for data that is intrinsically structured to represent $n$-fold interactions.
Our future works will focus on two directions in the computational aspects:  i) applying the SNNs to vector field data ii) comparing the previous and new results with state of the art imputations algorithms, as in~\cite{spinelli2020neural}. 
In parallel, on the theoretical side we will investigate the following two problems: i) generalizing the processes of coarsening and pooling to SNNs. This will involve developing an efficient higher dimensional clustering algorithm for coarsening and to find a meaningful rearrangement of the clustered $k$-simplices for an efficient pooling ii) studying the expressive power of SNNs similarly to~\cite{morris2019weisfeiler}.
