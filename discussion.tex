\section{Conlusion and Future Work}

In this work we have introduced a new mathematical framework to design neural networks dealing with simplicial complex and showed preliminary results of their
On the computational side, future works will focus on two directions: i)vector field data ii)comparing the results with state of the art techniques
As well in the theoretical side we will investigate the following two problem: i) generalizing the processes of coarsening and pooling to SNNs. This will involve developing an efficient higher dimensional clustering algorithm for coarsening and to find a meaningful rearrangement of the clustered $k$-simplices for an efficient pooling. One possible candidate is the Mapper-algorithm. ii) studying the expressive power of SNNs (like WL-tests)
