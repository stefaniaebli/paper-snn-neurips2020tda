\section{Introduction}

\begin{itemize}
\item Graph Neural Networks intro
\item Extension to simplicial complexes. 
\item Simplicial complex represent collaboration on which we have data like citations.
\item Preliminary results on vector field data. Where we believe this method can be applied and work?
\item Cite work on hypergraphs, message passing.
\item Advantage our work: low computational cost, Laplacian an operator encodes topological information has been extensively used in other application eg page ranking. In higher dimension we believe it carries additional information on the simplicial complex.
\end{itemize}
