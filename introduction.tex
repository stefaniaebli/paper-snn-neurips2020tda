\section{Introduction}

Graph-based convolutional neural networks (GNNs) have recently become popular techniques in machine learning~\cite{defferrard2016convolutional, bronstein2017geometric, wu2020survey}. Compared to classical convolutional deep neural networks that work with regular grid-structured data, graph neural networks can take into account irregular graphs to better learn complex interactions in the data~\cite{battaglia2018relational}. Although graphs are useful in describing complex systems of irregular relations in a variety of settings, they are intrinsically limited to modeling pairwise relationships. The advance of topological methods in machine learning~\cite{Gabrielsson2020topological, Hofer2019LearningRO, rieck2018neural}, and the earlier establishment of \emph{topological data analysis (TDA)}~\cite{carlsson2008,chazal2017,edelsbrunner2010computational,ghrist2008barcodes} as a field in its own right, have confirmed the usefulness of viewing data as topological spaces in general, or in particular as simplicial complexes, which can be thought of as a higher-dimensional analog of graphs~\cite{moore2012,patania2017}.

We here take the view that structure is encoded in \emph{simplicial complexes}, and that these represent $n$-fold interactions between objects. In this setting, we present \emph{simplicial neural networks (SNNs)}, a novel neural network framework that take into account locality of data living over a simplicial complex in the same way a GNN does for graphs or a conventional convolutional network does for grids. We show some useful properties of SNNs, indicate how they can be implemented as sparse matrix multiplications, and finally demonstrate the efficacy of the network on a dataset built from coauthorship data.

Other approaches, such as hypergraph neural networks~\cite{feng2018hypergraphs}, do not have connections to the global topological structure of the simplicial complex, a highly relevant aspect in TDA. This leads us to believe that our method is far better suited for situations where that is relevant, such as perhaps in the processing of data that exists naturally as vector fields or data that is sensitive to the space's global structure~\cite{perraudin2019deepsphere}.
