\paragraph{Simplicial Complexes.}
A \emph{simplicial complex} is a collection of finite sets closed under taking subsets.
We call a member of a simplicial complex $K$ a \emph{simplex} of \emph{dimension $p$} if it has cardinality $p+1$, and denote the set of all such $p$-simplices $K_p$.
A $p$-simplex has $p+1$ \emph{faces} of dimension $p-1$, namely the subsets omitting one element. We denote these $[v_0,\dotsc,\hat{v}_i,\dotsc, v_p]$ when omitting the $i$'th element.
If a simplex $\sigma$ is a face of $\tau$, we say that $\tau$ is a \emph{coface} of $\sigma$ .\mdeff{Only define what is used.}\stefania{Cofaces and faces are used in the simp. conv. section since part of that will go in the appendix I propose to put the definition of faces and cofaces there.}
While this definition is entirely combinatorial, there is a geometric interpretation, and it will make sense to refer to and think of $0$-simplices as \emph{vertices}, $1$-simplices as \emph{edges}, $2$-simplices as \emph{triangles}, $3$-simplices as \emph{tetrahedra}, and so forth (see Figure~\ref{fig:data2complex}, (b)).

Let $C^p(K)$ be the set of functions $K_p\to\RR$, with the obvious vector space structure. These \emph{$p$-cochains} will encode our data. Define the linear \emph{coboundary} maps $\delta^p:C^p(K)\to C^{p+1}(K)$ by
\begin{equation*}
\delta^p(f)([v_0,\dotsc,v_{p+1}]) = \sum_{i=0}^{p+1} (-1)^i f([v_0,\dotsc,\hat{v}_i,\dotsc,v_{p+1}]).
\end{equation*}

\paragraph{Simplicial Laplacians.}
We are in this paper concerned with finite abstract simplicial complexes, although our method is applicable to a much broader setting, such as for example finite CW-complexes. %\gard{I kinda liked the point that emphasized that the simplicial complexes don't need an embedding, but maybe there isn't space for it?}
%In particular, it is not necessary for the simplicial complexes to come equipped with some embedding into Euclidean spaces, nor do we demand that they triangulate a Riemannian manifold.
In analogy with Hodge--de Rham theory~\cite{madsen1997calculus}, we then define the \emph{degree-$i$ simplicial Laplacian} of a simplicial complex $K$ as the linear map $\lap_i:C^i(K)\to C^i(K)$ specified by
\begin{equation*}
  \lap_i = \lapu_i + \lapd_i = \delta^{{i}^{\ast}}\circ\delta^{i} + \delta^{i-1}\circ\delta^{{i-1}^{\ast}},
\end{equation*}

where $\delta^{{i}^{\ast}}$ is the adjoint of the coboundary with respect to the inner product (for example the one making the indicator function basis orthonormal).
In most practical applications, the coboundary can be represented as a sparse matrix $B_i$ and the Laplacians can be efficiently computed as $L_i=B_i\transpose B_{i}+B_{i-1}B_{i-1}\transpose$. \stefania{Still thinking about moving this to the appendix}
\mdeff{I think it's important to show how easy is the abstract description to actually implement. Maybe as a paragraph with $B$ and $L$ in a basis? Needed for Figure 1 anyhow.}\stefania{Oh yes, I totally agree with what you say. My comment above was not referring to the laplacians written with $B$ but to the following paragraph in which we describe its topological properties. I think it is important to say why the Laplacian encodes topological properties but if it was taking to much space I was thinking about moving it in the appendix..I think we can leave it here and see later..}
$B_0$ and $\mathcal{L}_0$ are the classic graph incidence matrix and Laplacian.
Since the Laplacians encode information about the adjacency of the simplices, they can be interpreted as a message passing functions~\cite{gilmer2017NeuralMP}.
\mdeff{Should go to conv.}\stefania{You mean in the simplicial convolution section?In this case, yes.}
Additionally, they carry valuable topological information about the simplicial complex. In particular, the kernel of the $k$-Laplacian is isomorphic to the $k$-(co)homology of its associated simplicial complex~\cite{eckmann1944,horak2013spectra}.
\footnote{In other words, the number of zero-eigenvalues tells us the number of $k$-dimensional holes~\cite{horak2013spectra}.}
\mdeff{The commented sentence would be useful to non-topologists. Maybe a footnote?}\stefania{Yes, I added one.}
